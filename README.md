# Credit Card Fraud Detection #

In this repository we will use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud. As described in the dataset, the features are scaled and the names of the features are not shown due to privacy reasons. Nevertheless, we can still analyze some important aspects of the dataset. Let's start!
Our Goals:
* Understand the distribution of the data.
* Create a 50/50 sub-dataframe ratio of "Fraud" and "Non-Fraud" transactions. 
* Determine the Classifiers we are going to use and decide which one has a higher accuracy.
* Understand common mistaked made with imbalanced datasets.
